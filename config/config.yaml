# Sample and Unit Sheet Section
#
# These file paths are essential for the workflow's operation and should not
# be altered. The workflow's internal scripts rely on these specific paths to
# correctly locate and process your sample and unit data. Modifying them will
# disrupt the pipeline and cause execution errors.

# Path to your SAMPLE SHEET which keeps track of your biological replicates
samples: "config/samples.tsv"
# Path to your sequencing UNIT SHEET which keeps track of your technical
# replicates (e.g. sequencer lanes or resequencing of the same biological
# sample)

  # MSigDB (Molecular Signatures Database) configuration

  #
  # Available collections:
  # - H: Hallmark gene sets (50 gene sets)
  # - C1: Positional gene sets (299 gene sets)
  # - C2: Curated gene sets (5,922 gene sets)
  # - C3: Regulatory target gene sets (3,738 gene sets)

    # Custom GMT files (optional)
    # Place your GMT files in resources/gmt/ and reference them here
    #
    # To use custom gene sets:
    # 1. Place your GMT file in the resources/gmt/ directory
    # 2. Uncomment the line below and replace "example_genesets.gmt" with your filename
    # 3. Ensure your GMT file follows the standard format (see resources/gmt/README.md)
    # 4. Make sure your gene IDs match the format used in your differential expression analysis
    #
    # Example GMT file format:
    # GENE_SET_1  Description of gene set 1 GENE1 GENE2 GENE3
    # GENE_SET_2  Description of gene set 2 GENE4 GENE5 GENE6 GENE7
    #

  # SPIA (Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis) configuration
  # SPIA performs topology-based pathway analysis considering both gene expression
  # changes and pathway structure. It identifies pathways that are significantly
  # perturbed based on the impact of differentially expressed genes on pathway
  # topology. The workflow automatically generates required SPIA data files
  # using makeSPIAdata() before running the analysis.
  #
  # Note: The kegg_organism parameter should be a three-letter KEGG organism code.
  # For a full list of supported organisms, see:
  # ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/xml/organisms
  #
  # IMPORTANT: SPIA uses the KEGG REST API (rest.kegg.jp) which is made available
  # only for academic use by academic users. Non-academic users are requested to
  # follow the guidelines shown in "Non-academic use of KEGG" at the KEGG website.
  # See: https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/ for API usage restrictions and
  # https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/legal.html for legal information.
  #
  # Rate limiting: The workflow automatically limits API calls to ~2.5 calls per
  # second (well within the KEGG limit of 3 calls per second) to avoid being
  # blocked by the KEGG server.
