# NCBI API Key
#
# To avoid potential rate-limiting issues when downloading data from NCBI,
# you can provide an API key here. The key will be used by the 'ncbi-datasets-cli'
# tool, which is used for fetching genomes and SRA datasets.

# Read Quality Control and Quantification
#
# This section configures the initial stages of the workflow, from quality
# control (QC) of raw sequencing reads to the generation of feature counts.
# The parameters below for each tool allow for fine-tuning the pipeline's
# performance and behavior.

# Differential Expression Section:
#
# This section defines the parameters for the differential gene expression
# analysis. It allows you to specify the experimental design, including the
# factors and contrasts to be analyzed with DESeq2. You can configure multiple
# analyses, each with its own formula and settings, to explore different
# aspects of your data.

# Pathway Enrichment Section:
#
# This section configures the pathway enrichment analysis, which helps to
# interpret the biological meaning of the differentially expressed genes.
# It uses the 'clusterProfiler' R package to perform Over-Representation
# Analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on gene sets from
# GO and KEGG databases.
#
# For more details on 'clusterProfiler', see:
# https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/

  # MSigDB (Molecular Signatures Database) configuration
  # MSigDB provides gene sets for enrichment analysis using clusterProfiler's
  # universal enrichment functions (enricher() and GSEA()). The workflow supports
  # both built-in MSigDB collections and custom GMT files.
  #
  # Available collections:
  # - H: Hallmark gene sets (50 gene sets)
  # - C1: Positional gene sets (299 gene sets)
  # - C2: Curated gene sets (5,922 gene sets)
  # - C3: Regulatory target gene sets (3,738 gene sets)
  # - C4: Computational gene sets (858 gene sets)
  # - C5: Ontology gene sets (10,922 gene sets)
  # - C6: Oncogenic signatures (189 gene sets)
  # - C7: Immunologic signatures (4,872 gene sets)
  # - C8: Cell type signature gene sets (746 gene sets)
  #
  # For more information, see: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/

    # List of MSigDB collections to analyze (H, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8)
    # For CI/CD testing, use only H (Hallmark) to avoid timeout issues
    collections:
      - "H" # Hallmark gene sets (50 gene sets - suitable for CI/CD)
    # Custom GMT files (optional)
    # Place your GMT files in resources/gmt/ and reference them here
    #
    # To use custom gene sets:
    # 1. Place your GMT file in the resources/gmt/ directory
    # 2. Uncomment the line below and replace "example_genesets.gmt" with your filename
    # 3. Ensure your GMT file follows the standard format (see resources/gmt/README.md)
    # 4. Make sure your gene IDs match the format used in your differential expression analysis
    #
    # Example GMT file format:
    # GENE_SET_1  Description of gene set 1 GENE1 GENE2 GENE3
    # GENE_SET_2  Description of gene set 2 GENE4 GENE5 GENE6 GENE7
    #
    # Available custom gene sets:
    # - muscle_genesets.gmt: 1,517 muscle-related gene sets (see resources/gmt/README.md)
    custom_gmt_files: [] # Example: ["resources/gmt/example_genesets.gmt"]
  # SPIA (Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis) configuration
  # SPIA performs topology-based pathway analysis considering both gene expression
  # changes and pathway structure. It identifies pathways that are significantly
  # perturbed based on the impact of differentially expressed genes on pathway
  # topology. The workflow automatically generates required SPIA data files
  # using makeSPIAdata() before running the analysis.
  #
  # IMPORTANT: SPIA uses the KEGG REST API (rest.kegg.jp) which is made available
  # only for academic use by academic users. Non-academic users are requested to
  # follow the guidelines shown in "Non-academic use of KEGG" at the KEGG website.
  # See: https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/ for API usage restrictions and
  # https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/legal.html for legal information.
  #
  # Rate limiting: The workflow automatically limits API calls to ~2.5 calls per
  # second (well within the KEGG limit of 3 calls per second) to avoid being
  # blocked by the KEGG server.
