  # num_exp_conditions
  # ------------------
  # Integer value that lets the workflow know how many experimental conditions
  # are in the workflow. In the provided examples in samples.tsv and units.tsv
  # there are four experimental conditions:
  # celltype, crispr_modified, suspension_adapted, and additional_treatment
  num_exp_conditions: 4
  # exp_conditions
  # ------------------
  # exp_conditions does not have a value itself, but it has subgroups that are
  # experimental variables for which you would like to determine whether or
  # not they have an effect on expression levels
  exp_conditions:
    celltype:
      # any fold change will be relative to this factor level
      base_level: C2C12
    crispr_modified:
      # any fold change will be relative to this factor level
      base_level: untreated
    suspension_adapted:
      # any fold change will be relative to this factor level
      base_level: adherent
  # batch_effects
  # -------------
  # variables whose effect you want to model to separate them from your
  # variables_of_interest
  batch_effects:
    - sequencing_batch
  # contrasts for the deseq2 results method to determine fold changes
  contrasts:
    treatment_1:
      # must be one of the variables_of_interest, for details see:

      variable_of_interest: treatment_1

      # base_level specified above
      level_of_interest: ko
  # The default model includes all interactions among variables_of_interest
  # and batch_effects added on. For the example above this implicitly is:
  # model: ~sequencing_batch + treatment_1 * treatment_2
  # For the default model to be used, simply specify an empty `model: ""` below.
  # If you want to introduce different assumptions into your model, you can
  # specify a different model to use, for example skipping the interaction:
  # model: ~sequencing_batch + treatment_1 + treatment_2
