report_comment: "The NCBI [GENBANK/REFSEQ] assembly of the [SPECIES] reference \
  genome [ASSEMBLY SYNONYM] ([ASSEMBLY VERSION]) was used for alignment and \
  pseudo-alignment. Additionally, the selective alignment mapping strategy
  was used for Salmon transcript quantification using a decoy-aware \
  transcriptome that was built with a k-mer length of \
  [REPLACE WITH config[params][salmon_index][kmer_len]]."
