AB  - Biomaterial scaffolds play a pivotal role in the advancement of cultured meat technology, facilitating essential processes like cell attachment, growth, specialization, and alignment. Currently, there exists limited knowledge concerning the creation of consumable scaffolds tailored for cultured meat applications. This investigation aimed to produce edible scaffolds featuring both smooth and patterned surfaces, utilizing biomaterials such as salmon gelatin, alginate, agarose and glycerol, pertinent to cultured meat and adhering to food safety protocols. The primary objective of this research was to uncover variations in transcriptomes profiles between flat and microstructured edible scaffolds fabricated from marine-derived biopolymers, leveraging high-throughput sequencing techniques. Expression analysis revealed noteworthy disparities in transcriptome profiles when comparing the flat and microstructured scaffold configurations against a control condition. Employing gene functional enrichment analysis for the microstructured versus flat scaffold conditions yielded substantial enrichment ratios, highlighting pertinent gene modules linked to the development of skeletal muscle. Notable functional aspects included filament sliding, muscle contraction, and the organization of sarcomeres. By shedding light on these intricate processes, this study offers insights into the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the generation of muscle-specific cultured meat.
