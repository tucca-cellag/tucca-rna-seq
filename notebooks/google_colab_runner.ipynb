        "**`tucca-cellag/tucca-rna-seq`** is a modular RNA-Seq workflow developed in the [Kaplan Lab at TUCCA](https://cellularagriculture.tufts.edu/) and is adaptable for most RNA-Seq projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, this workflow was tailored for cellular agriculture research, focusing on the analysis of muscle and fat cell transcriptomes. Over time, it has been expanded into a flexible and modular tool suitable for a broad range of RNA-Seq applications. Its adaptable design allows for easy modification to fit various experimental needs beyond its original scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a self-contained environment to run the `tucca-rna-seq` workflow on Google Colab, eliminating the need for local installation. It automates the setup of all dependencies, including `mamba`, `Snakemake`, and `Apptainer`.\n",
        "\n",
        "> [!WARNING]\n",
        "> This workflow is still under construction. [Release v0.9.0](https://github.com/tucca-cellag/tucca-rna-seq/releases/tag/v0.9.0) marks our first public release. v0.9.0 contains all logic to process raw paired-end RNA-Seq reads through differential expression. The centerpiece of the v1.0.0 release will be an interactive analysis toolkit that allows you to dynamically explore and visualize your results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:\n",
        "- **Zero Local Installation**: Runs the entire workflow in the cloud.\n",
        "- **Persistent Caching**: Connects to your Google Drive to cache `conda` environments and `renv` packages, speeding up subsequent runs.\n",
        "- **Full Functionality**: Executes the complete, unmodified workflow, ensuring reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Use:\n",
        "1.  **Run the cells sequentially**: Execute each cell in order from top to bottom.\n",
        "2.  **Authorize Google Drive access**: When prompted, grant permission for this notebook to access your Google Drive. This is required for caching.\n",
        "3.  **Configure your analysis**: Modify the `config.yaml`, `samples.tsv`, and `units.tsv` files as needed for your specific experiment.\n",
        "4.  **Execute the workflow**: Run the final cell to start the Snakemake pipeline.\n",
