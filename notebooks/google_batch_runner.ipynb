        "\n",
        "This notebook orchestrates the `tucca-rna-seq` workflow on **Google Cloud Batch**, a fully managed service for running batch computing workloads at scale. Unlike the `google_colab_runner.ipynb`, which runs the entire workflow on a single Colab instance, this notebook uses Colab as a lightweight client to submit jobs to Google's powerful cloud infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:\n",
        "- **Massive Scalability**: Execute hundreds or thousands of jobs in parallel on powerful, custom-configured virtual machines.\n",
        "- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the compute resources you use. Google Batch automatically spins up and shuts down VMs for each job.\n",
        "- **Centralized Storage**: Utilizes Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for all workflow data, ensuring it's accessible to all jobs.\n",
        "- **Orchestration from Colab**: Use the familiar Colab interface to manage and monitor your large-scale analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Use:\n",
        "1.  **Set up Google Cloud**: Ensure you have a Google Cloud project with billing enabled.\n",
        "2.  **Authenticate**: Run the authentication cell to grant this notebook access to your Google Cloud account.\n",
        "3.  **Configure Storage**: Specify your GCS bucket and upload your data.\n",
        "4.  **Execute the Workflow**: Run the final cell to submit the workflow to Google Batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's get started!\n"
