**`tucca-cellag/tucca-rna-seq`** is a modular RNA-Seq workflow developed in the
[Kaplan Lab at TUCCA][tucca]. It provides a complete, end-to-end pipeline that
processes raw FASTQ files through quality control, quantification, differential
expression, and pathway enrichment analysis.

Initially tailored for cellular agriculture research on muscle and fat cell
transcriptomes, the workflow has been designed with modularity and flexibility
at its core. This allows users to easily customize the pipeline by adding,
removing, or modifying steps to suit a broad range of RNA-Seq applications
and experimental designs.

This workflow was developed using the [Snakemake][snakemake] workflow management
system. `tucca-rna-seq` is a standardized usage Snakemake workflow that follows
the [best practices][best-prac] laid out in the Snakemake documentation (as of
Snakemake v9.3) and can be found in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog][swc].

> [!WARNING]
> This workflow is still under construction. [Release v0.9.0][v0.9.0] marks our first
> public release. v0.9.0 contains all logic to process raw paired-end RNA-Seq
> reads through differential expression. Currently, the workflow can generate a
> large number of DESeq2 result files, especially for experiments with multiple
> conditions and contrasts. While this is thorough, we recognize that navigating
> dozens of individual result files can be challenging. The centerpiece of the
> v1.0.0 release will be an interactive analysis toolkit that allows you to
> dynamically explore and visualize your results. This will include a suite of
> Shiny applications leveraging powerful packages like [`pcaExplorer`][pcaExplorer],
> [`ideal`][ideal], and [`GeneTonic`][GeneTonic] to bring your data to life, as well as
> custom scripting to generate our favorite [`clusterProfiler`][clusterProfiler] figures.
>
> **Looking Ahead: AI-Powered Analysis Integration**
>
> Beyond v1.0.0, we're developing an innovative AI-powered analysis platform
> that will integrate directly with this workflow. This platform will feature a
> private Large Language Model (LLM) chat application connected to your RNA-Seq
> results, enabling natural language queries about your data. The system will
> automatically vectorize workflow outputs and provide intelligent,
> context-aware analysis assistance.
>
> We encourage users to test this v0.9.0 release and provide feedback. Users should
> expect our documentation to be incomplete and continue to have major reworks
> until v1.0.0 is released. Please [open an issue][open-issue] to report any bugs or
> suggest improvements. Additionally, feel free to [contact us][contact] with

## What is Cellular Agriculture? üß¨üå±

**Cellular Agriculture** is a cutting-edge field that harnesses biotechnology
to produce agricultural products directly from cells. Unlike traditional
farming, which relies on raising and harvesting whole organisms, cellular
agriculture focuses on cultivating animal cells in controlled environments to
create sustainable alternatives for meat, dairy, and other animal-derived
products.

### **Why Cellular Agriculture Matters**

- **Sustainability üåç:** Reduces the environmental impact associated with
  conventional agriculture, including lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduced
  land and water usage, and minimized waste production.
- **Ethical Considerations üêÆ‚ù§Ô∏è:** Offers humane alternatives by eliminating the
  need for animal slaughter, addressing animal welfare concerns.
- **Food Security üçΩÔ∏è:** Enhances the ability to produce food in areas with
  limited agricultural resources, contributing to global food security.
- **Innovation and Research üî¨:** Drives advancements in biotechnology,
  genetics, and bioinformatics, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and
  novel scientific discoveries.
