    type: string
    description: >
      Sample name/identifier:
      A unique identifier for the sample, representing an individual biological
      replicate. The identifier should be an alphanumeric string and may
      include underscores ("_") and hyphens ("-").
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z_0-9-]+$"
  unit_name:
    type: string
    description: >
      Unit name/identifier:
      Used to distinguish between multiple sequencing runs (or lanes) for the
      same physical sample, which represent technical replicates rather than
      additional biological replicates. The identifier is an alphanumeric
      string, that may additionally contain '_' and '-'.
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z_0-9-]+$"

    type: string
    description: >
      FASTQ file for forward reads:
      Provide the file path to the FASTQ file containing the sequencing data
      for read 1 (the forward reads).
  fq2:
    type: string
    description: >
      FASTQ file for reverse reads:
      Provide the file path to the FASTQ file containing the sequencing data
      for read 2 (the reverse reads).
  sra:
    type: string
    description: >
      SRA accession number:
      Provide the SRA run accession number for the sequencing unit. It should
      be in the format "SRR" followed by one or more digits (e.g., SRR123456).
    pattern: "^SRR[0-9]+$"
